# PoKeys Custom Post-GUI HAL
# Created: 2025-07-30
# Purpose: Additional HAL connections after GUI is loaded

# This file is loaded after the GUI starts
# Use for connections that need GUI pins

# Connect some GUI indicators if needed
# net jog-speed <= halui.jog-speed
# net max-velocity <= halui.max-velocity.value

# Add any custom GUI connections here
# For basic testing, this file can remain minimal
