## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRG analysis uses failure data from testing to:
- **Fit multiple SRG models** (Musa-Okumoto, Goel-Okumoto, Jelinski-Moranda, Crow/AMSAA)
- **Assess goodness-of-fit** (which model best represents the data)
- **Estimate current reliability** (MTBF, failure rate)
- **Predict future reliability** (residual defects, time to target MTBF)
- **Support release decision** (is software ready to release?)

### 1.2 SRG Concept (IEEE 1633 Clause 6.3)

**Software Reliability Growth (SRG)** is the phenomenon where:
- As defects are detected and fixed, reliability **increases** over time
- Failure rate **decreases** over time
- MTBF **increases** over time

**SRG Models** mathematically describe this growth process, enabling predictions.

```

**Visual Inspection**: Cumulative failures show [linear/logarithmic/exponential] growth pattern.

## 3. Trend Analysis

### 3.1 Trend Test Purpose (IEEE 1633 Clause 6.3.2)

**Before fitting models**, test if reliability is **actually growing**:
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Failure times are random (no reliability growth)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Failure times show trend (reliability growth or decay)

**If no trend detected**: Reliability not improving, investigate and fix more defects before release.

### 3.2 Laplace Trend Test (IEEE 1633 Clause 6.3.2.1)

**Formula**:
```
u = [Σ(t_i) / M - T/2] / [T * sqrt(1/(12*M))]

Where:
  M = number of failures
  T = total test time
  t_i = time of i-th failure
```

**Interpretation**:
- **u > 2**: Reliability is **decreasing** (failures increasing) - Bad! ❌
- **-2 ≤ u ≤ 2**: **No trend** detected (failures random) - Investigate 🤔
- **u < -2**: Reliability is **increasing** (failures decreasing) - Good! ✅

**Calculation**:
```
M = [Number of failures]
T = [Total test time] hours
Σ(t_i) = [Sum of all failure times]

u = [Σ(t_i) / M - T/2] / [T * sqrt(1/(12*M))]
u = [Calculated value]
```

**Result**: u = [Value]
**Interpretation**: [Reliability is increasing/decreasing/no trend]
**Confidence**: [95% confidence interval]

### 3.3 Arithmetic Mean (AM) Trend Test (IEEE 1633 Clause 6.3.2.2)

**Formula**:
```
AM(i) = Mean of TBF for failures i to M

If AM(i) increases with i → Reliability growing ✅
If AM(i) decreases with i → Reliability declining ❌
```

**Calculation**:

| Group | Failures | Mean TBF | Trend |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1-5 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | [X] hours | Baseline |
| 6-10 | 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 | [Y] hours | [Increasing/Decreasing] |
| 11-15 | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 | [Z] hours | [Increasing/Decreasing] |

**Plot**:
```
Mean TBF |
         |         ×
         |     ×
         | ×
         |_____________
           1-5  6-10  11-15
              Failure Groups
```

**Result**: Mean TBF [increasing/decreasing/flat]
**Interpretation**: Reliability [growing/declining/stable]

### 3.4 Trend Test Conclusion

**Laplace Test**: u = [Value] → [Growing/No trend/Declining]
**AM Test**: Mean TBF [Increasing/Flat/Decreasing] → [Growing/Stable/Declining]

**Overall Conclusion**: ✅ Reliability is growing, proceed with model fitting
                        OR
                        ❌ No reliability growth detected, do NOT release, investigate

  Solve: 1 / λ(t) = Target MTBF
  t_target = [Value] hours (additional [t_target - T] hours needed)

Expected failures in next [Δt] hours: μ(T + Δt) - μ(T) = [Value]
```

---

### 6.3 Predictions (Using Best-Fit Model)

#### 6.3.1 Time to Reach Target MTBF

**Target MTBF**: [X] hours
**Current MTBF**: [Y] hours

**Calculation**:
```
Solve: MTBF(t) = Target MTBF
Using [Model Name] equations...

t_target = [Calculated time] hours
```

**Result**:
- **Additional Test Time Required**: [t_target - T_current] hours
- **Additional Calendar Time**: [Estimate based on test effort] days/weeks
- **Estimated Completion Date**: [Date]

#### 6.3.2 Expected Failures in Next Test Period

**Next Test Period**: [Δt] hours (e.g., 1 week = 40 test hours)

**Prediction**:
```
Expected Failures = μ(T + Δt) - μ(T)
                  = [Calculated value] failures
```

**Interpretation**: Expect [N] failures in next [Δt] hours of testing.

#### 6.3.3 Residual Defects (For Finite Failure Models)

**Total Defects (N₀)**: [Estimated from model]
**Detected Defects**: [M]
**Residual Defects**: N₀ - M = [Value]

**Breakdown by Severity** (if available):
| Severity | Residual Count | Estimated Remaining % |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Critical (FDSC 10) | [N] | [%] |
| High (FDSC 7-9) | [N] | [%] |
| Medium (FDSC 4-6) | [N] | [%] |
| Low (FDSC 1-3) | [N] | [%] |

### 6.4 Sensitivity Analysis

**What if we test for X more hours?**

| Additional Test Time (hours) | Predicted MTBF | Predicted Residual Defects | Target Met? |
|------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 0 (current) | [Current MTBF] | [Current residual] | ❌ |
| 20 | [MTBF at T+20] | [Residual at T+20] | ❌ |
| 50 | [MTBF at T+50] | [Residual at T+50] | ❌ |
| 100 | [MTBF at T+100] | [Residual at T+100] | ✅ |

1. ✅ **If Ready**: Proceed to release (use `reliability-release-decision` prompt for final checklist)
2. ⏳ **If Additional Testing Required**: 
   - Continue testing for [X] more hours
   - Focus on [specific areas]
   - Re-run SRG analysis after additional testing
3. ❌ **If Not Ready**:
   - Fix outstanding critical defects
   - Investigate why reliability not growing (if u > -2)
   - Reassess requirements/design quality

### 7.3 Risk Assessment

**Risks if Released Now**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk description] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |

**Example**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Critical defect in field | Medium | Critical | Provide hotfix support, monitor production closely |
| MTBF lower than target | High | High | Set customer expectations, plan maintenance release |

## 8. Model Validation

### 8.1 Validation Approach

**Prequential Likelihood** (Prediction Validation):
- Use first 80% of failure data to fit model
- Predict failures in remaining 20%
- Compare predictions to actual failures

**Cross-Validation**:
- Split data into training/test sets
- Fit model on training set
- Validate on test set

### 8.2 Validation Results

**Prequential Likelihood Ratio**:
```
Training Data: Failures 1 to [M×0.8]
Test Data: Failures [M×0.8 + 1] to M

Predicted Failures in Test Period: [N_predicted]
Actual Failures in Test Period: [N_actual]
Prediction Error: |N_predicted - N_actual| / N_actual = [%]
```

| Model | Prediction Error (%) | Validation Quality |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Musa-Okumoto | [X%] | [Good/Poor] |
| Goel-Okumoto | [Y%] | [Good/Poor] |
| Jelinski-Moranda | [Z%] | [Good/Poor] |
| Crow/AMSAA | [W%] | [Good/Poor] |

**Best Predictive Model**: [Model name] (lowest prediction error)

### 8.3 Model Limitations

**Assumptions Violated**:
- [ ] Defects fixed immediately (some fixes delayed)
- [ ] All defects have equal hazard rate (some are harder to find)
- [ ] No new defects introduced (some fixes introduce new defects)

**Data Quality Issues**:
- [ ] Insufficient failures (M < 20)
- [ ] Insufficient test time
- [ ] Clustered failures (not independent)

**Recommendations**:
[Address limitations, collect more data, use model with caution, etc.]

## 🎯 Your Task: Complete SRG Model Fitting and Analysis

### Step-by-Step Workflow (IEEE 1633 Clause 5.4, 6.3):

1. **Collect Failure Data**
   - From reliability test execution (use `reliability-test-design` prompt)
   - Need: Failure times (hours), severity, test case, operation
   - Minimum M ≥ 20 failures for reliable fitting

2. **Perform Trend Tests**
   - **Laplace Test**: Is reliability growing? (u < -2 = yes)
   - **Arithmetic Mean Test**: Is mean TBF increasing?
   - If no trend → investigate, do NOT proceed to release

3. **Fit Multiple Models**
   - Select 3-4 models (Musa-Okumoto, Goel-Okumoto, Jelinski-Moranda, Crow/AMSAA)
   - Use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate parameters
   - Calculate current MTBF, failure rate, residual defects

4. **Assess Goodness-of-Fit**
   - Calculate SSE, R², AIC for each model
   - Select best-fit model (lowest SSE, highest R², lowest AIC)
   - Plot predicted vs. observed cumulative failures

5. **Make Predictions**
   - Current reliability (MTBF, failure rate)
   - Time to reach target MTBF
   - Expected failures in next test period
   - Residual defects (for finite models)

6. **Provide Release Recommendation**
   - Compare current metrics to targets (from SRPP)
   - Assess risk of releasing now
   - Recommend: Release / Additional Testing / Do Not Release

7. **Validate Model**
   - Use prequential likelihood (80% training, 20% test)
   - Calculate prediction error
   - Document model limitations

## 💡 SRG Modeling Tips

### Why SRG Modeling?
- **Quantify reliability**: Convert failure data to MTBF, failure rate
- **Predict future reliability**: Estimate time to reach targets
- **Support release decision**: Objective basis for go/no-go
- **Track improvement**: Demonstrate reliability is growing over time

### Model Selection Guidelines:
- **Musa-Okumoto**: Large systems, evolving requirements, defects introduced during fixes
- **Goel-Okumoto**: Stable requirements, finite defects, good for most projects
- **Jelinski-Moranda**: Simple, easy to explain, good baseline
- **Crow/AMSAA**: No assumptions about defect distribution, good for early testing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- ❌ Fitting models without trend test (may not be growing)
- ❌ Selecting model based on "gut feel" (use goodness-of-fit metrics)
- ❌ Insufficient data (M < 20 failures → unreliable estimates)
- ❌ Ignoring model assumptions (e.g., assuming defects fixed immediately when they're not)
- ❌ Extrapolating too far into future (models accurate near current time)

### Data Quality Requirements:
- **Independence**: Failures should be independent (not clustered)
- **Completeness**: All failures recorded (not just critical ones)
- **Accuracy**: Failure times accurate (not just "day 1", need precise times)
- **Severity**: Classify per FDSC (for weighted models)

## 📝 Example: Goel-Okumoto Model Fitting

**Failure Data** (M = 30 failures, T = 500 hours):
```
[10.5, 25.3, 31.8, 45.2, 58.7, 72.1, 89.4, 105.2, 123.8, 145.6, 
 168.9, 195.3, 224.7, 256.8, 291.2, 327.4, 365.8, 405.2, 445.7, 486.3,
 527.1, 567.9, 608.5, 649.0, 689.3, 729.4, 769.3, 809.1, 848.7, 888.2]
```

**Laplace Test**:
```
M = 30
T = 888.2 hours
Σ(t_i) = 13,956.5 hours

u = [13,956.5 / 30 - 888.2 / 2] / [888.2 * sqrt(1 / (12 * 30))]
u = [465.2 - 444.1] / [888.2 * 0.0527]
u = 21.1 / 46.8 = 0.45
```
**Result**: u = 0.45 (within [-2, 2]) → **No strong trend detected** ⚠️

**Interpretation**: Reliability may not be growing strongly. Investigate and continue testing.

**Model Fitting (Goel-Okumoto)** using MLE:
```
N₀ = 85.2 defects
b = 0.0045 per hour

Current metrics (at T = 888.2 hours):
μ(T) = 85.2 * (1 - e^(-0.0045 * 888.2)) = 85.2 * 0.975 = 83.1 failures
λ(T) = 85.2 * 0.0045 * e^(-0.0045 * 888.2) = 0.0095 failures/hour
MTBF(T) = 1 / 0.0095 = 105.3 hours
Residual defects = 85.2 - 83.1 = 2.1 defects
```

**Prediction** (target MTBF = 200 hours):
```
Solve: 1 / λ(t) = 200
     1 / [N₀ * b * e^(-b*t)] = 200
     e^(-b*t) = 1 / (N₀ * b * 200)
     -b*t = ln(1 / (85.2 * 0.0045 * 200))
     t = -ln(0.0130) / 0.0045 = 958.3 hours

Additional test time needed: 958.3 - 888.2 = 70.1 hours
```

## 🔗 Related Artifacts

After completing SRG analysis:
1. **Update SRPP** - Report current MTBF, residual defects in Section 6 (Reliability Predictions)
2. **Make Release Decision** - Use `reliability-release-decision` prompt with SRG results
3. **Continue Testing** - If target not met, continue testing and re-run SRG analysis
4. **Plan Maintenance** - Use residual defect estimate to plan post-release support

SRG analysis feeds into:
- **Release Decision** (use `reliability-release-decision.prompt.md`) - Final go/no-go
- **Reliability Predictions** (SRPP Section 6) - Report to stakeholders
- **Test Planning** (next release) - Set targets based on current results

## 📝 Notes for AI Assistant

- **Always deliver complete SRG analysis report** - don't just provide a template
- **Ask for failure data** - Need actual failure times, not just summaries
- **Perform trend test FIRST** - Don't fit models if reliability not growing
- **Fit multiple models** - Don't just fit one model, compare 3-4
- **Show calculations** - Display formulas, parameter estimation, predictions
- **Assess goodness-of-fit** - Calculate SSE, R², AIC and explain which model is best
- **Make specific predictions** - Time to target MTBF, expected failures in next period, residual defects
- **Provide release recommendation** - Clear go/no-go based on targets from SRPP

**Remember**: SRG modeling is the **quantitative foundation** for release decisions. Without SRG, release decisions are subjective. With SRG, you have objective, data-driven estimates of reliability!
