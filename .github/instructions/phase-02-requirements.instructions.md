# Phase 02: Requirements Analysis & Specification

**Standards**: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (System Requirements), ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017  
**XP Integration**: User Stories, Acceptance Tests, YAGNI Principle

## 🎯 Phase Objectives

1. Transform stakeholder requirements into system requirements
2. Define functional and non-functional requirements
3. Create detailed use cases and user stories
4. Establish requirements traceability
5. Define testable acceptance criteria
6. **Generate System Acceptance Test Plan and System Qualification Test Plan** (IEEE 1012-2016)

## 📋 Requirements Capture Method

### GitHub Issues (Primary and Recommended)

**All requirements MUST be captured as GitHub Issues** using the Functional Requirement (REQ-F) or Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF) templates.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No YAML front matter required - metadata captured via issue fields, labels, and project columns
- ✅ Traceability via `#N` syntax in issue bodies
- ✅ ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 compliance via issue templates
- ✅ Automated validation via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Real-time collaboration and discussion
- ✅ Integration with pull requests and CI/CD
- ✅ Searchable and filterable with labels and milestones

## 📋 ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Compliance

### System Requirements Process Activities

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Decompose stakeholder requirements
   - Identify system boundaries
   - Define interfaces
   - Analyze feasibility
   - Resolve conflicts

2. **System Requirements Specification**
   - Define functional requirements
   - Define non-functional requirements (quality attributes)
   - Specify constraints
   - Define interfaces
   - Create System Requirements Specification (SyRS)

3. **Requirements Validation**
   - Review for completeness
   - Check consistency
   - Verify traceability to stakeholder requirements
   - Validate with stakeholders

## 🎨 XP Practices for This Phase

### User Stories
Transform requirements into user stories:
```markdown
As a [user role]
I want to [action/capability]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]
```

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Only specify requirements for current iteration + 1
- Avoid speculative features
- Keep requirements minimal and focused

### Acceptance Test-Driven Development
- Define acceptance tests BEFORE implementation
- Make acceptance criteria executable
- Customer defines acceptance tests

## 🧪 Testing Artifacts in Phase 02 (IEEE 1012-2016 V&V)

### Critical Distinction: Testing Is Not Just Execution

**Testing is a lifecycle-parallel process of planning, design, and execution.** Testing artifacts are created throughout the development lifecycle, not just during implementation or validation phases.

### IEEE 1012-2016 Requirements Phase V&V Tasks

During the **System Requirements Definition** phase, V&V requires generating:

1. **System Acceptance Test Plan**
   - **Purpose**: Define how the system will be validated against stakeholder needs
   - **Content**: Test strategy, scope, resources, schedule, acceptance criteria
   - **Traceability**: Each stakeholder requirement → Acceptance test approach
   - **XP Equivalent**: Customer acceptance tests written as user stories

2. **System Qualification Test Plan**
   - **Purpose**: Define how system requirements will be verified
   - **Content**: Test approach for functional and non-functional requirements
   - **Traceability**: Each system requirement → Qualification test method
   - **XP Equivalent**: Executable acceptance tests (specification by example)

### Test Artifacts Across Lifecycle Phases

| Lifecycle Phase | IEEE 1012 Artifact | TDD/Agile Equivalent | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Requirements (Phase 02)** | Test **Plan** (Acceptance/Qualification) | Acceptance Tests (User Stories) | Define WHAT to test and HOW to measure success |
| **Architecture (Phase 03)** | Test **Design** (Integration/System) | System Metaphor / Spike Solutions | Design test approach for components and integration |
| **Design (Phase 04)** | Test **Cases** (detailed scenarios) | Unit Tests (TDD - written BEFORE code) | Specify inputs, expected outputs, execution conditions |
| **Implementation (Phase 05)** | Test **Procedures** & Execution | Code Implementation & Refactoring | Execute tests, implement code to pass tests |

### Why Test Planning Happens in Phase 02

**Objective Acceptance Criteria**: By defining test plans during requirements, you ensure:
- ✅ Requirements are testable (if you can't define how to test it, it's not verifiable)
- ✅ Stakeholders agree on success criteria before implementation begins
- ✅ Ambiguous requirements are exposed early (clarification before coding)
- ✅ Traceability established from requirement → test → implementation
- ✅ Cost of defect detection reduced (cheaper to fix requirements than code)

### TDD/Agile Perspective: Tests Drive Requirements Clarity

**In TDD, writing the test IS the requirements clarification activity:**
- Writing acceptance tests forces you to clarify vague requirements
- If a test is difficult to write, the requirement is incomplete or ambiguous
- Executable tests become living documentation of expected behavior
- Stakeholders validate requirements by reviewing/approving tests

### Phase 02 Test Deliverables

#### 1. System Acceptance Test Plan Template

**Location**: `02-requirements/test-plans/system-acceptance-test-plan.md`

```markdown
# System Acceptance Test Plan

**Standard**: IEEE 1012-2016, IEEE 829-2008  
**Project**: [Project Name]  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: [Date]

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Define how the system will be validated against stakeholder requirements to ensure it solves the right problem for stakeholders.

### 1.2 Scope
This plan covers acceptance testing for all stakeholder requirements (StR) documented in Phase 01.

### 1.3 References
- Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS) - GitHub Issues labeled `type:stakeholder-requirement`
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 - Requirements Engineering
- IEEE 1012-2016 - Verification and Validation

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Test Approach
- **Customer-Driven**: Stakeholders define acceptance criteria
- **Scenario-Based**: Real-world usage scenarios
- **Executable**: Automated where possible (Gherkin/Cucumber)
- **Early Validation**: Acceptance tests written during requirements phase

### 2.2 Test Levels
- **Alpha Testing**: Internal validation with simulated stakeholder scenarios
- **Beta Testing**: External validation with actual stakeholders
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Final stakeholder sign-off

### 2.3 Test Types
- Functional acceptance (business processes work correctly)
- Operational acceptance (system meets operational needs)
- Contractual acceptance (meets contractual obligations)
- Regulatory acceptance (compliance requirements)

## 3. Traceability Matrix: StR → Acceptance Tests

| Stakeholder Requirement | Acceptance Test ID | Test Method | Priority | Stakeholder |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| StR-001: [Requirement] | AT-001 | Scenario-based | P0 | [Name] |
| StR-002: [Requirement] | AT-002 | Demonstration | P1 | [Name] |

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

For each stakeholder requirement, define:
- **Given**: Initial context/preconditions
- **When**: Action or event
- **Then**: Expected outcome (measurable)

### Example: StR-001 Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a system administrator
  I want secure user authentication
  So that only authorized users access the system

Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given a registered user with username "testuser" and password "SecurePass123!"
  And the system is operational
  When the user submits valid credentials
  Then the user is authenticated within 2 seconds
  And the user session is created
  And the user is redirected to the dashboard

Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
  Given a registered user with username "testuser"
  When the user submits an incorrect password
  Then the system displays "Invalid credentials" error
  And the login attempt is logged
  And the user is NOT authenticated

Scenario: Account lockout after 3 failed attempts
  Given a registered user with username "testuser"
  When the user submits incorrect password 3 times
  Then the account is locked for 15 minutes
  And the user receives "Account locked" message
  And an email is sent to the user's registered email
```

## 5. Test Resources

```

#### 2. System Qualification Test Plan Template

**Location**: `02-requirements/test-plans/system-qualification-test-plan.md`

```markdown
# System Qualification Test Plan

**Standard**: IEEE 1012-2016, IEEE 829-2008  
**Project**: [Project Name]  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: [Date]

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Define how system requirements (functional and non-functional) will be verified to ensure the system is built correctly according to specifications.

### 1.2 Scope
This plan covers qualification testing for all system requirements (REQ-F, REQ-NF) documented in Phase 02.

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Test Approach
- **Requirements-Based**: Every requirement has verification method
- **Multi-Level**: Unit → Integration → System → Acceptance
- **TDD-Driven**: Tests written before implementation (Phase 05)
- **Automated**: Continuous integration with automated test execution

### 2.2 Verification Methods (per IEEE 1012)

For each requirement, specify verification method:

| Method | Description | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Test** | Execute with defined inputs, verify outputs | Most functional requirements | Login function test |
| **Analysis** | Mathematical/logical proof | Algorithms, performance models | Throughput calculation |
| **Inspection** | Visual examination | UI requirements, documentation | Screen layout review |
| **Demonstration** | Operational verification | User workflows | End-to-end scenario demo |

## 3. Traceability Matrix: REQ → Qualification Tests

| System Requirement | Verification Method | Test Case IDs | Test Design Phase | Test Execution Phase |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| REQ-F-001: User login | Test | TC-F-001 to TC-F-005 | Phase 04 | Phase 05 |
| REQ-NF-001: Response time <200ms | Test + Analysis | TC-NF-001, TC-NF-002 | Phase 04 | Phase 05 |
| REQ-F-002: Password reset | Test | TC-F-010 to TC-F-012 | Phase 04 | Phase 05 |

**Critical**: Every REQ-F and REQ-NF MUST have at least one verification method defined.

## 4. Test Design Approach (Detailed in Phase 04)

While test **plans** are created in Phase 02, test **cases** are designed in Phase 04 (Design phase).

### 4.1 Functional Test Cases (REQ-F)
For each functional requirement, design test cases covering:
- **Happy path**: Normal expected operation
- **Alternative paths**: Valid variations
- **Error paths**: Invalid inputs, error conditions
- **Boundary conditions**: Min/max values, edge cases

### 4.2 Non-Functional Test Cases (REQ-NF)

#### Performance Tests
- **Load testing**: System behavior under expected load
- **Stress testing**: Behavior beyond normal capacity
- **Endurance testing**: Sustained operation over time
- **Spike testing**: Sudden load increases

#### Security Tests
- **Authentication tests**: Valid/invalid credentials
- **Authorization tests**: Access control verification
- **Injection tests**: SQL injection, XSS prevention
- **Encryption tests**: Data protection verification

#### Usability Tests
- **Task completion**: Time to complete core tasks
- **Error recovery**: User can recover from mistakes
- **Learnability**: New user productivity metrics

## 5. Test Environment Requirements

### 5.1 Hardware
- [Specification of test hardware]

### 5.2 Software
- Operating systems: [List]
- Databases: [List]
- Browsers: [List for web applications]

### 5.3 Test Data
- Production-like data (anonymized)
- Boundary condition data sets
- Invalid/malicious data for security tests

## 6. Test Execution Schedule (Phase 05)

| Test Level | Phase | Responsible | Duration |
|-----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Unit Tests (TDD) | Phase 05 | Developers | Continuous |
| Integration Tests | Phase 06 | Dev + QA | 2 weeks |
| System Tests | Phase 07 | QA Team | 3 weeks |
| Acceptance Tests | Phase 07 | Stakeholders | 1 week |

## 7. Success Criteria

System qualification testing is complete when:
- ✅ 100% of REQ-F requirements verified (all test cases pass)
- ✅ 100% of REQ-NF requirements verified (metrics met)
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 80% (code coverage)
- ✅ No critical or high-severity defects open
- ✅ All verification evidence documented and traceable

## 8. Defect Management

### 8.1 Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System unusable, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major functionality broken, no workaround
- **Medium**: Functionality impaired, workaround exists
- **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic defect

### 8.2 Defect Workflow
1. Defect identified during testing
2. Logged as GitHub Issue with label `type:defect`
3. Linked to failing requirement (e.g., "Breaks REQ-F-042")
4. Prioritized and assigned
5. Fixed with PR linking defect issue
6. Verified with regression test
7. Defect issue closed

### Integration with GitHub Issues

**Link test plans to requirements**:

When creating REQ-F or REQ-NF issue:

```markdown
## Verification Method
**Primary Method**: Test  
**Test Plan**: System Qualification Test Plan (Section 3.5)  
**Test Case IDs**: TC-F-042-001 to TC-F-042-005 (to be created in Phase 04)

**Acceptance Criteria** (testable):
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [measurable outcome]

**Metrics** (for REQ-NF):
- Response time: <200ms (p95)
- Throughput: >10,000 TPS
- Error rate: <0.01%

## Test Strategy Notes
- Unit tests: Verify function-level behavior
- Integration tests: Verify component interaction
- System tests: Verify end-to-end workflow
- Performance tests: Load test with 1000 concurrent users
```

### XP Perspective: Tests as Specifications

**In XP/TDD, acceptance tests ARE the detailed requirements:**

```gherkin
# File: 02-requirements/acceptance-tests/login-authentication.feature

Feature: User Authentication (REQ-F-042)
  As a registered user
  I want to securely log in to the system
  So that I can access my personalized dashboard

  Background:
    Given the system is operational
    And the following users exist:
      | username | password | role |
      | alice | SecurePass1! | admin |
      | bob | SecurePass2! | user |

  @critical @req-f-042
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter username "alice"
    And I enter password "SecurePass1!"
    And I click "Login"
    Then I should be redirected to "/dashboard" within 2 seconds
    And I should see "Welcome, alice"
    And my session should be active

  @critical @req-f-042
  Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter username "alice"
    And I enter password "WrongPassword"
    And I click "Login"
    Then I should remain on the login page
    And I should see error "Invalid username or password"
    And my failed attempt should be logged
    And no session should be created

  @security @req-f-042 @req-nf-sec-003
  Scenario: Account lockout after 3 failed attempts
    Given I am on the login page
    When I attempt login with username "alice" and wrong password 3 times
    Then I should see error "Account locked due to multiple failed attempts"
    And the account "alice" should be locked for 15 minutes
    And an email should be sent to alice's registered email address
    And I should not be able to login even with correct password for 15 minutes
```

These Gherkin scenarios serve as:
1. **Executable specifications** (run with Cucumber/SpecFlow)
2. **Living documentation** (always up-to-date)
3. **Acceptance tests** (stakeholder validates by reviewing scenarios)
4. **Detailed requirements** (Given-When-Then clarifies expected behavior)



## 📝 Requirements Documentation Approach

### ⭐ PRIMARY: GitHub Issues (Recommended)

**System requirements should be captured as GitHub Issues** using the Functional Requirement (REQ-F) or Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF) templates.

#### Creating Functional Requirements as GitHub Issues

1. **Navigate to Issues → New Issue**
2. **Select Template**: "Functional Requirement (REQ-F)"
3. **Complete Required Fields**:
   - **Title**: Clear capability statement (e.g., "User can export data to CSV format")
   - **Parent Stakeholder Requirement**: Link to parent StR issue using `#N` syntax
   - **Requirement Description**: What the system shall do (use "shall" for mandatory)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions (Given-When-Then format)
   - **Priority**: Critical (P0) / High (P1) / Medium (P2) / Low (P3)
   - **Integrity Level**: 1 (highest) through 4 (lowest) per IEEE 1012-2016
   - **Dependencies**: Other requirements this depends on
   - **Verification Method**: Inspection / Analysis / Demonstration / Test
   
4. **Apply Labels**:
   - `functional-requirement` (auto-applied by template)
   - `phase-02` (lifecycle phase)
   - `priority-*` and `integrity-*` labels
   
5. **Submit** → GitHub assigns issue number (e.g., #45)

6. **Set Status in GitHub Project** (see [Status Management Guide](../../docs/github-issue-status-management.md#2️⃣-system-requirements-req)):
   - **Initial Status**: "Specified"
   - **Progression**: Specified → Analyzed → Traceable → Approved → Implemented → Verified
   - **Close When**: Fully implemented and verified (all tests pass)

#### Creating Non-Functional Requirements as GitHub Issues

1. **Navigate to Issues → New Issue**
2. **Select Template**: "Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF)"
3. **Complete Required Fields**:
   - **Title**: Quality attribute with metric (e.g., "System response time under 200ms for 95th percentile")
   - **Parent Stakeholder Requirement**: Link to parent StR issue (`#N`)
   - **Quality Attribute Category**: Performance / Security / Usability / Reliability / Maintainability / Portability
   - **Requirement Description**: Specific quality constraint
   - **Measurable Criteria**: Objective metrics and targets
   - **Verification Method**: How to test/measure compliance
   - **Priority** and **Integrity Level**
   
4. **Apply Labels**:
   - `non-functional-requirement`
   - `phase-02`
   - Category-specific labels if available

5. **Set Status in GitHub Project**: Same progression as REQ-F (Specified → Analyzed → Traceable → Approved → Implemented → Verified)

#### Example: Creating REQ-F Issue

**Title**: User can filter product list by multiple categories

**Parent Stakeholder Requirement**:
```markdown
Traces to:  #1 (StR: Improve product discovery experience)
```

**Requirement Description**:
```markdown
The system **shall** allow users to:
1. Select multiple product categories simultaneously (e.g., "Electronics" AND "Sale Items")
2. Apply filters with AND/OR logic
3. See real-time count of matching products
4. Clear all filters with single action
5. Save filter combinations for future use
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```markdown
### Scenario 1: Apply multiple filters
**Given** user is on product listing page  
**And** at least 100 products exist across 5+ categories  
**When** user selects "Electronics" AND "Sale Items" filters  
**Then** system displays only products matching both categories  
**And** product count updates to show "23 items"  
**And** response time is < 500ms

### Scenario 2: Clear filters
**Given** user has 3 filters applied  
**When** user clicks "Clear All Filters" button  
**Then** all filters are removed  
**And** full product list is displayed  
**And** filter count shows "0 active filters"

### Scenario 3: Save filter combination
**Given** user has applied 2+ filters  
**When** user clicks "Save Filters" and enters name "My Electronics Deals"  
**Then** filter combination is saved to user profile  
**And** appears in "Saved Filters" dropdown on next visit
```

**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Integrity Level**: 2 (high criticality)  
**Dependencies**: REQ-F-012 (Product catalog API), REQ-NF-015 (Database query performance)  
**Verification Method**: Test (automated integration tests + manual UAT)

**Labels**: `functional-requirement`, `phase-02`, `priority-high`, `integrity-2`

After submission → Issue #45 created

#### Example: Creating REQ-NF Issue

**Title**: Search results return within 200ms for 95% of queries

**Parent Stakeholder Requirement**:
```markdown
Traces to:  #2 (StR: Fast, responsive user experience)
```

**Quality Attribute Category**: Performance

**Requirement Description**:
```markdown
The system **shall** return search results with the following performance characteristics:
- **95th percentile**: ≤ 200ms response time
- **99th percentile**: ≤ 500ms response time
- **Average**: ≤ 100ms response time
- **Database queries**: Maximum 3 queries per search
- **Concurrent users**: Performance maintained under 1000 concurrent users
```

**Measurable Criteria**:
```markdown
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| P95 response time | ≤ 200ms | APM tool (New Relic) |
| P99 response time | ≤ 500ms | APM tool |
| Average response | ≤ 100ms | APM tool |
| Query count | ≤ 3 queries | Database profiler |
| Load capacity | 1000 concurrent | Load testing (JMeter) |
```

**Verification Method**:
```markdown
1. **Performance Testing**: JMeter load test with 1000 virtual users
2. **Production Monitoring**: APM tool continuous monitoring
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: All metrics met for 7 consecutive days in production
```

**Priority**: Critical (P0)  
**Integrity Level**: 1 (highest - customer-facing performance)

**Labels**: `non-functional-requirement`, `phase-02`, `priority-critical`, `integrity-1`

After submission → Issue #46 created

#### Traceability via GitHub Issues

Requirements trace to parent stakeholder requirements:
```markdown
## Traceability
- Traces to:  #1, #2 (parent StR issues)
- **Depends on**: #12, #15 (prerequisite requirements)
- **Refined by**: #78, #79 (child design decisions in Phase 03)
- **Implemented by**: #PR-25 (pull request)
- **Verified by**: #120, #121 (test case issues)
```

**Automated Validation**: GitHub Actions validates:
- Every REQ-F/REQ-NF has at least one parent StR link
- Parent issues exist and are labeled `stakeholder-requirement`
- No circular dependencies
- All dependencies resolved before marking requirement complete

#### Querying Requirements

Use GitHub search:
```
# All functional requirements
is:issue label:functional-requirement label:phase-02

# High priority non-functional requirements
is:issue label:non-functional-requirement label:priority-high

# Performance requirements
is:issue label:non-functional-requirement "performance" in:title

# Requirements tracing to specific StR
is:issue label:functional-requirement "#1" in:body
```

Or use GitHub MCP via Copilot:
```
List all functional requirements for Phase 02
Show non-functional requirements with priority critical
```

#### Generate Requirements Specification from Issues

```bash
# Generate System Requirements Specification document
python scripts/github-traceability-report.py --type requirements --output SyRS.md
```

Produces ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148-compliant specification document from issues.

#### Status Management Workflow

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** requires maintaining requirements attributes including baseline status and verification status. See [GitHub Issue Status Management Guide](../../docs/github-issue-status-management.md#2️⃣-system-requirements-req) for detailed workflow.

**Quick Reference - REQ Status States**:

| Status | Definition | When to Apply |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Specified** | Requirement written in clear, testable form | Passes EARS template check |
| **Analyzed** | Checked for ambiguity, consistency, necessity | Criticality assigned, conflicts resolved |
| **Traceable** | Linked upward (StR) and downward (ADC) | All traceability links present |
| **Approved** | Formally approved and baselined | Stakeholder/technical approval |
| **Implemented** | Design and code completed | PR merged with REQ reference |
| **Verified** | Objective evidence confirms fulfillment | All test cases pass |

**Updating Status** (add comment to issue):
```markdown
## Status Update (2025-12-10)
**Previous Status**: Specified
**New Status**: Analyzed
**Analysis Results**:
- Ambiguity check: PASS (clear EARS format)
- Consistency check: PASS (no conflicts with #46)
- Necessity check: PASS (traces to StR #1)
- **Criticality**: High (security-related, integrity level IL-3)
- **Risk**: Medium (third-party API dependency)

**Next Steps**: Add traceability links to architecture components (ADR #78, ARC-C #79)
```

**Verification Evidence** (when moving to "Verified"):
```markdown
## Verification Complete (2025-12-18)
**Status**: Verified → Ready to Close
**Test Cases**: #120 (PASS), #121 (PASS), #122 (PASS)

```

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Set status to "Specified" upon creation (after template validation)
- ✅ Update status with evidence at each transition
- ✅ Don't skip "Analyzed" or "Traceable" states (required for compliance)
- ✅ Close only when fully verified (tests pass with objective evidence)
- ✅ Link PRs and test results in status update comments
- ❌ Never move to "Approved" without criticality analysis
- ❌ Don't move to "Implemented" without PR link
- ❌ Don't move to "Verified" without test evidence

## 🚨 Critical Requirements for This Phase

### Always Do
✅ Trace every system requirement to stakeholder requirement(s)  
✅ Define testable acceptance criteria for every requirement  
✅ Include non-functional requirements (not just functional)  
✅ Use consistent requirement IDs (REQ-F-XXX, REQ-NF-XXX)  
✅ Write user stories in Given-When-Then format  
✅ Prioritize with customer involvement (Planning Game)  
✅ Document assumptions and dependencies explicitly  
✅ Validate requirements with stakeholders  
✅ Use "shall" for mandatory binding provisions  
✅ Write requirements that specify "what" not "how" (avoid design constraints)  
✅ Make requirements verifiable and testable with objective criteria  
✅ Use active voice in requirement statements  
✅ Apply YAGNI: specify only for current iteration + 1  
✅ Define acceptance tests BEFORE implementation (ATDD)  
✅ Customer defines acceptance tests  
✅ Focus on delivering value; maximize work NOT done  
✅ Recognize that requirements constantly change; embrace evolution  

### Never Do
❌ Create untraceable requirements  
❌ Use ambiguous language ("fast," "user-friendly," superlatives, subjective terms)  
❌ Mix requirements with design solutions  
❌ Skip non-functional requirements  
❌ Create requirements without acceptance criteria  
❌ Proceed with inconsistent or conflicting requirements  
❌ Specify requirements for "future" features (YAGNI / No gold plating)  
❌ Use loopholes ("if possible", "as appropriate", "as applicable")  
❌ Use "must" (use "shall" for mandatory, "should" for desired)  
❌ Write negative requirements ("shall not")  
❌ Wait for requirements to be "finished" before design/implementation  
❌ Build for tomorrow based on hypothetical needs  
❌ Value requirements only for developers (e.g., dictating specific tech stack)
