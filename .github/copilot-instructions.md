## 🔗 Traceability Workflow (GitHub Issues)

### All Work Must Start with an Issue

Before any implementation, design, or testing work:
1. Navigate to **Issues → New Issue**
2. Select appropriate template:
   - **Stakeholder Requirement (StR)** - Business needs and context
   - **Functional Requirement (REQ-F)** - System functional behavior
   - **Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF)** - Quality attributes (performance, security, etc.)
   - **Architecture Decision (ADR)** - Architectural choices and rationale
   - **Architecture Component (ARC-C)** - Component specifications
   - **Quality Scenario (QA-SC)** - ATAM quality attribute scenarios
   - **Test Case (TEST)** - Verification and validation specifications
3. Complete **ALL required fields** (marked with red asterisk)
4. Link to parent issues using `#N` syntax
5. Submit → GitHub auto-assigns unique issue number
6. **Update status when starting work** - See [GitHub Issue Workflow](../docs/github-issue-workflow.md) for status management

### Issue Linking Rules (Bidirectional Traceability)

**Upward Traceability** (Child → Parent):
```markdown
## Traceability
- **Traces to**: #123 (parent StR issue)
- **Depends on**: #45, #67 (prerequisite requirements)
```

**Downward Traceability** (Parent → Children):
```markdown
## Traceability
- **Verified by**: #89, #90 (test issues)
- **Implemented by**: #PR-15 (pull request)
- **Refined by**: #234, #235 (child requirements)
```

**Required Links**:
- REQ-F/REQ-NF **MUST** trace to parent StR issue
- ADR **MUST** link to requirements it satisfies
- ARC-C **MUST** link to ADRs and requirements
- TEST **MUST** link to requirements being verified
- All PRs **MUST** link to implementing issue(s)

### Issue Reference Syntax

In issue bodies, PR descriptions, and code comments:
```markdown

```

### Pull Request Workflow

**Every PR MUST**:
1. Link to implementing issue using `Fixes #N` or `Implements #N` in description
2. Reference issue number in commit messages
3. Pass all CI checks including traceability validation
4. Have at least one approved review

### When Generating Code

**Always include issue references in code**:

```python
"""
User authentication module.

Implements: #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login)
Architecture: #45 (ADR-SECU-001: JWT Authentication)
Verified by: #89 (TEST-AUTH-LOGIN-001)

See: https://github.com/zarfld/copilot-instructions-template/issues/123
"""
class AuthenticationService:
    pass
```

```typescript
/**
 * User login endpoint
 * 
 * @implements #123 REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login
 * @see https://github.com/zarfld/copilot-instructions-template/issues/123
 */
export async function loginUser(credentials: Credentials): Promise<User> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### When Creating Tests

**Link tests to verified requirements**:

```python
"""
Test user login functionality.

Verifies: #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login)
Test Type: Integration
Priority: P0 (Critical)

Acceptance Criteria (from #123):
  Given user has valid credentials
  When user submits login form
  Then user is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
"""
def test_user_login_success():
    # Test implementation
```

```typescript
describe('User Login (Verifies #123)', () => {
  /**
   * Verifies: REQ-F-AUTH-001 (Issue #123)
   * Acceptance Criteria: User can log in with valid credentials
   */
  it('should authenticate user with valid credentials', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### When Documenting Architecture

**ADRs must reference requirements**:

```markdown
# ADR-SECU-001: Use JWT for Authentication

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Issue**: #45

## Context
Requirement #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001) requires secure user authentication.

## Decision
We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across services

### Requirements Satisfied
- #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login)
- #124 (REQ-NF-SECU-002: Session Security)
```

## 🎨 General Guidelines

### When User Provides Requirements

1. **Create Issue First** - Before any work:
   - Use appropriate issue template
   - Complete all required fields
   - Link to parent issues
   - Get issue number assigned

2. **Clarify Ambiguities** - Ask questions about:
   - Unclear functional requirements
   - Missing non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
   - Stakeholder priorities and constraints
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical constraints
   - Parent issue relationships

3. **Apply Appropriate Phase** - Identify which lifecycle phase the work belongs to

4. **Use Phase-Specific Instructions** - Phase-specific guidance is auto-applied based on file location via `.github/instructions/phase-NN-*.instructions.md`

5. **Maintain Traceability** - Every artifact links to GitHub issues:
   ```
   StR Issue (#1) → REQ-F Issue (#2) → ADR Issue (#4) → Code (PR #10) → TEST Issue (#7)
   ```

### When Writing Code

1. **Test-First (TDD)**:
   ```
   Red → Write failing test
   Green → Write minimal code to pass
   Refactor → Improve design while keeping tests green
   ```

2. **Simple Design Principles**:
   - Pass all tests
   - Reveal intention clearly
   - No duplication (DRY)
   - Minimal classes and methods

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Integrate frequently (multiple times per day)
   - Run all tests before integration
   - Fix broken builds immediately

### When Reviewing/Analyzing Code

1. Check compliance with:
   - Design specifications (IEEE 1016)
   - Coding standards
   - Test coverage (target >80%)
   - Documentation completeness

2. Verify traceability:
   - Tests cover requirements
   - Code implements design
   - Documentation is current

### Documentation Standards

All documentation must follow:
- **IEEE 1016-2009** format for design documents
- **IEEE 42010:2011** format for architecture documents
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** format for requirements
- **Markdown** format for specs (Spec-Kit compatible)

### File Organization

```
applyTo:
  - "**/*.md"           # All markdown files
  - "**/*.js"           # JavaScript files
  - "**/*.ts"           # TypeScript files
  - "**/*.py"           # Python files
  - "**/*.java"         # Java files
  - "**/*.cs"           # C# files
  - "**/src/**"         # All source code
  - "**/tests/**"       # All test files
  - "**/docs/**"        # All documentation
```

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### Always Do
✅ Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear  
✅ Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD) - absolute rule, no exceptions  
✅ Challenge and prove every assumption with tests or experiments  
✅ Use spike solutions for technical unknowns (time-boxed learning)  
✅ Maintain requirements traceability via GitHub Issues  
✅ Follow the phase-specific copilot instructions  
✅ Document architecture decisions (ADRs) with empirical justification  
✅ Include acceptance criteria in user stories  
✅ Run all tests before committing code  
✅ Fix CI breaks immediately (<10 minutes)  
✅ Update documentation when code changes  
✅ Keep Red-Green-Refactor cycle under 10 minutes  
✅ State temporal requirements in measurable terms (for real-time systems)  
✅ Keep ISRs terse and efficient (<5µs hard, <50µs soft real-time)  
✅ Measure timing empirically (GPIO + oscilloscope) before claiming compliance  
✅ Listen to instincts (fear, "walking uphill" = design problem)  
✅ Seek feedback in minutes/hours (not weeks)  
✅ Report bad news immediately (max reaction time for stakeholders)  
✅ Provide options (not excuses) when reporting problems  
✅ Separate estimates from promises (promise truth, not dates)  
✅ Make status visible (15-second glance = Big Visible Charts)  
✅ Celebrate changing your mind when facts change  
✅ Use Five Whys to find root causes (often people problems)  
✅ Focus on team problems (not individual blame)  

### Never Do
❌ Proceed with ambiguous requirements  
❌ Start implementation without creating/linking GitHub issue  
❌ Write code without tests  
❌ Write code BEFORE writing a failing test (TDD violation)  
❌ Assume code works without proof ("I'm pretty sure this will work")  
❌ Build speculative features ("We might need this later")  
❌ Copy-paste code without understanding and testing  
❌ Trust documentation without empirical verification  
❌ Create PR without `Fixes #N` or `Implements #N` link  
❌ Write tests without linking to requirement issue  
❌ Make architecture decisions without ADR issue  
❌ Skip documentation updates  
❌ Ignore standards compliance  
❌ Break existing tests  
❌ Commit untested code  
❌ Let CI stay broken for >10 minutes  
❌ Create circular dependencies  
❌ Ignore security considerations  
❌ Create orphaned requirements (no parent/child links)  
❌ Put complex logic in ISRs (real-time systems)  
❌ Use blocking calls in time-critical code  
❌ Use unbounded iterations in hard real-time code  
❌ Claim timing guarantees without measurement proof  
❌ Ignore negative emotions (fear = cue something is wrong)  
❌ Report "90% done" without working software  
❌ Hide bad news or delay reporting problems  
❌ Promise deadlines (only estimate and promise truth)  
❌ Blame individuals (focus on team/systemic solutions)  
❌ Report progress without objective data (tests, velocity)  
❌ Say "It works on my machine" (working = deployed + tested)  
❌ Work under a lie (if behind, adjust plan immediately)

## 🔍 When to Ask Questions

Ask the user to clarify when:

1. **Requirements are vague** - "Should this feature support multiple users?"
2. **Non-functional requirements missing** - "What are the performance requirements?"
3. **Design alternatives exist** - "Would you prefer approach A or B because...?"
4. **Security implications** - "Should this data be encrypted?"
5. **Scope unclear** - "Should this feature include X or is that out of scope?"
6. **Acceptance criteria undefined** - "How will we know this feature is complete?"
7. **Technical constraints unknown** - "Are there any platform or technology constraints?"
8. **Priority unclear** - "Is this a must-have or nice-to-have feature?"

### Question Format

Use structured questions:
```markdown
## Clarification Needed

**Context**: [Explain what you're trying to implement]

**Questions**:
1. [Specific question about functional requirement]
2. [Question about non-functional requirement]
3. [Question about acceptance criteria]

**Impact**: [Explain why these answers matter]
```

## 📚 Issue-Driven Development

Use GitHub Issues as the source of truth for requirements, architecture, and tests:

1. **Stakeholder Requirement (StR) Issue** → Drives system requirements
2. **Functional/Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-F/REQ-NF) Issues** → Generate test cases
3. **Architecture Decision (ADR) Issues** → Drive design decisions
4. **Architecture Component (ARC-C) Issues** → Generate code structure
5. **Test Case (TEST) Issues** → Generate test implementations

### Workflow

```markdown
1. Create StR issue for business need (#1)
2. Create REQ-F issues linked to StR (#2, #3)
3. Create ADR and ARC-C issues for architecture (#5, #6)
4. Implement with TDD (PR links to issues)
5. Create TEST issues to verify requirements (#10, #11)
6. Close issues when verified and deployed
```

**All artifacts reference GitHub Issues using `#N` syntax for bidirectional traceability.**

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A well-executed task should:
- ✅ Meet all applicable IEEE/ISO/IEC standards
- ✅ Follow XP practices (especially TDD)
- ✅ Have complete traceability
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Have clear, complete documentation
- ✅ Pass all quality gates
- ✅ Satisfy user acceptance criteria

## Documentation & Instruction Files

always do:
- ensure existing documentation is updated alongside code changes
- keep documentation consistent with implemented features
- 

never do:
- leave documentation outdated or inconsistent with code
- create speculative documentation for unimplemented features
- create new MD when existing documenation already captures that topic

### correction of newly created files which should have been updates to existing documentation:

Documentation Integrity (The Boy Scout Rule): Always leave the documentation healthier than you found it. Instead of allowing documentation to fragment into multiple files, practice Litter-Pickup Refactoring:
• Consolidate: Integrate new scopes into the primary information items rather than spawning "orphaned" files.
• Validate: Ensure the baseline document is semantically correct and inclusive of all new details before discarding the temporary artifact.
• Purge: After verifying full content parity remove redundant files immediately once their content is successfully merged to prevent misdirection.
